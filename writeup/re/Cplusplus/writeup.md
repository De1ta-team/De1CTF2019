### analyze

```C++
struct st {
	unsigned short num1;
	unsigned short num2;
	unsigned short num3;
};

st boostFn(const std::string& s) {
	using boost::spirit::qi::_1;
	using boost::spirit::qi::ushort_;
	using boost::spirit::qi::char_;
	using boost::phoenix::ref;

	struct st res;
	const char* first = s.data();
	const char* const end = first + s.size();
	bool success = boost::spirit::qi::parse(first, end,
		ushort_[ref(res.num1) = _1] >> char('@')
		>> ushort_[ref(res.num2) = _1] >> char('#')
		>> ushort_[ref(res.num3) = _1]
	);

	if (!success || first != end) {
		//throw std::logic_error("Parsing failed");
		_exit(0);
	}
	return res;
}
```

This code is related to `boost::spirit`. The input is such as `num1@num2#num3`, and the three `unsigned short` values are separated by `@ #`.

```C++
void boostFunc(unsigned short& num) {
	//random number check
	//The expected num is 78
	if (num > 111) {
		_exit(0);
	}
	boost::mt19937 rng(num);
	rng.discard(num % 12);
	//Copy Construction, retain all the state
	boost::mt19937 rng_(rng);
	rng_.discard(num / 12);
	//discarding num random results
	if (rng_() != 3570126595) {
		_exit(0);
	}
	num -= (rng_() % 45);	// 45
}
```

An `unsigned short` is passed in, less than or equal to 111. It is used as the seed of the random engine, discarding `num % 12` random numbers, and then constructing a random engine copy.

> Note that the copy construct here completely preserves the state of the random engine, not the initial state.
>
> In IDA, it behaves as a direct memcpy

Then discard the `num/12` random numbers.

Then output a random number requirement equal to `3570126595`, and finally the value passed in is changed because it is a reference.



There is nothing to say in the second check .

The third check is my mistake

```C++
if ((res.num3 % res.num1 != 12) && (res.num3 / res.num1) != 3) {
		//3 * 34 + 12 == 114
		std::cout << "You failed...again";
		_exit(0);
	}
```

There have been many solutions here, and later I found out that `||` was mistakenly written as `&&`, so as long as the formula on the right is satisfied, the flag will be output, and finally `md5` will be guaranteed to guarantee the unique solution.

This is my mistake, I am sincerely sorry.
